## Terminology

`ES5` stands for ECMAScript 5. Also known as JavaScript 5.

`ES6` ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6. ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript. 

`ES6+` The `+` means ES6 and higher versions.

`Vinllia JS` just means plain Javascript, no frameworks or libraries. The term comes from an online joke around a super fast lightweight JavaScript library called Vanilla JS.
If you downloaded it, the file size would be 0kb, the joke being no such library exists.
